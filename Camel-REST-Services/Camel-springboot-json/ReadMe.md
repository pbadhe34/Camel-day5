This app demonstrates how to use Rest DSL with Spring Boot
and configured in the application.properties file.

Try this example by running these goals:

    mvn spring-boot:run
    
And then from a web browser open:

    http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1
    
  or

    http://localhost:8080/api/orders/2
